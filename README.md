â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```
## Content Management

- For landing, Collection not to be used as each section will evolve for different schema
- decoupling content markdown to ease presentation and localization 
- use attributes for taglines
- it's not possible to group content by headings as  `getHeadings()` does not provide content 

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
