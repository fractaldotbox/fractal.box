Exploring public goods funding mechanisms and fair economic models for software is a key reason why we are in the field.

We strive to build Ethereum-aligned, local-first, open source software such as Geist dDevKit, a top grant receiver of Gitcoin. Our founders were organizers and speakers of various open source and developer communities since 2013. 


To pay it forward, We are also in the works of open source no-code tool for public goods communities.
