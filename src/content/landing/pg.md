Exploring fair economic models for sofware and public goods funding is a key reason why we are in the field.

We built Open source for the ecosystems, such as Geist dappKit which raised $10k from Gitcoin. Our founders were organizers and speakers of various open source and developer communities since 2013. 

To pay it forward, We are also build open source no-code tool for public goods communities.
